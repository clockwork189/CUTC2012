                    <h3>And you thought only musicians went on tour.</h3>
                   Cross Canada, CUTC style. We've been thinking for a while that all of Canada deserves to have an amazing experience no matter where they are in the country, so what better way to share CUTC than coming to YOU? That's right. We're packing up, taking some of our amazing speakers, grabbing a few gadgets and going.  <br/><br/>
It's like the conference and an ice cream truck all rolled up in: all the sweetness of CUTC, the speakers, the competitions, and events, but with the capability of coming to you (We promise that there won't be cheesy music following us where ever we go). Not to mention the fact that making a visit to the CUTC Tour stops won't just be enjoyable for a couple bites or melt all over you - it's going to be an intense experience packed with all that the National Conference has and more.  <br/><br/>
So, want a taste of CUTC, right on your street? We have stops in Vancouver (January 28), Toronto (February 4), and Montreal (February 11). Bring your friends, bring your cousins, bring your sister or brother! You know that special someone that you've been trying to make a move on for weeks and haven't thought of anything interesting to ask them out to? This is your chance!   A memorable experience, all within a short distance of your bed - no hotels, no suits, just awesomeness. <br/><br/>
