                    Want a taste of CUTC, right in your backyard? In 2012, we're taking our conference on tour, with stops in Vancouver (January 28), Toronto (February 4), and Montreal (February 11). Each stop will feature the hottest local speakers and some of our most successful competitions and events from past years. We wanted to share the CUTC experience with even more students, and the tour is our solution.
