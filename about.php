                    <h3>We change how you think about technology.</h3>
                    Let's face it - you get the gist of what we're about. Techie gathering, largest undergraduate conference in Canada, a weekend of awesomeness, etc., etc., etc.<br/><br/>
We think it's more important that you understand <em>why</em>. <br/><br/>
See, the most important thing to our founders and to us is passion.<br/><br/>
Like that temperamental, crazy hippie Steve Jobs said, "The only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do." He may have been insane, but he made a dent in the universe. We're hoping a weekend at CUTC will give you the inspiration, the passion, the perspective and the tools to do the same. That's what we're really about. You.<br/><br/>
Beyond the amazing speakers and boundary-pushing companies, we'll bring in hundreds of your peers with whom you will share a few beers, kick around some ideas, and spark a few mutual dreams. You might just join the ranks of some of the greatest relationships in history: Jobs and Wozniak, Buckingham and Nicks, Jesus and Mary. <br/><br/>
All you have to do is buy a ticket, and take a chance. We'll take care of the rest. <br/><br/>
We do it for love. You should too. 
                    <h3>And if you get a chance, check out what we were up to at <a href="http://www.dev.cutc.ca/cutc2011" target="_blank" style="color:#be1212; ">last year's Conference</a>?</h3>
