                   CUTC's national conference has always been the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me of events. But why have one when you can have TWO! That's right, national conference will not be in just one city but two cities this year. Travelling out west for the CUTC Tour has got us so excited, we knew we had to have a conference there as well.  <br/><br/>
The national conference will take place in Calgary (April 27 and 28) and Toronto (April 28 and 29), giving our delegates of choice if they want to participate in the beautiful Canadian west or the urban beauty of Toronto. Both conferences will have everything CUTC: hundreds of hours of incredible speakers, events, and workshops packed into two breakneck days.
